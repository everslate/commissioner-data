Background & Programming Philosophy

Christopher Mitchell leads BBC World Service Eye Investigations, a strand focused on investigative documentaries in the Arabic-speaking world. His remit covers BBC Arabic (linear TV), BBC iPlayer (English-language versions), and wider BBC digital platforms including YouTube.

He values journalism with international depth, strong editorial purpose, and disciplined production.
